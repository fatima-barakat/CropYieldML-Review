# CropYieldML-Review

## Aim of the Repository

The aim of this repository is to systematically investigate and replicate the most commonly used deep learning algorithms for crop yield prediction. Specifically, the project focuses on:

1. **Building three representative models**  
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
   - Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM)  
   - Deep Neural Networks (DNN)  

2. **Evaluating the models on available datasets**  
   - Identify and use datasets that include the most important features for crop yield prediction, such as temperature, rainfall, and soil type.  
   - Document dataset sources and feature coverage.

3. **Analyzing input features**  
   - Assess which features are critical for accurate predictions.  
   - Explore how feature selection affects model performance.

**Scope and Limitations**  
- The repository focuses on **replication and reproducibility**, not on developing novel algorithms.  
- Availability and completeness of datasets are a key challenge, and experiments will be limited to publicly accessible data containing essential features.
