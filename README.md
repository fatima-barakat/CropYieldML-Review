# CropYieldML-Review

## Purpose

This repository presents a systematic, code-supported review of machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction.

The project translates findings from peer-reviewed literature into reproducible baselines and controlled experiments, with an emphasis on model selection, input features, evaluation metrics, and practical limitations in agricultural data.

## Scope Boundaries

This project focuses on reviewing and reproducing machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction. It **does not**:

- Claim to develop state-of-the-art predictive models
- Provide production-ready agricultural solutions
- Guarantee accuracy on unseen datasets
- Cover all possible machine learning algorithms exhaustively

The goal is to translate scientific literature into reproducible baselines and controlled experiments, highlighting strengths, limitations, and gaps in the current research.
