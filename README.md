# CropYieldML-Review

## Purpose

This repository presents a systematic, code-supported review of machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction.

The project translates findings from peer-reviewed literature into reproducible baselines and controlled experiments, with an emphasis on model selection, input features, evaluation metrics, and practical limitations in agricultural data.
